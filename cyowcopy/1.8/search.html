It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]\nPreamble\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.\nWe call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\nThis License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.\n\nA &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\nThe &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)\n&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n\nThe modified work must itself be a software library.\n\nYou must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\nYou must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\nIf a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n\n(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n\nYou may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\n\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\nA program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\nHowever, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\nWhen a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\nAs an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\n\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\n\nAccompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\n\nUse a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\nAccompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\nIf distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.\n\nVerify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n\nFor an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\n\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n\nAccompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\n\nGive prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n\n\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\n\nEach time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\nIf the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\nBECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

It also counts\nas the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\nthe version number 2.1.]\nPreamble\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode. If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\nWe call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License. It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a\n&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\nGNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\nThis License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).\nEach licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.\n\nA &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\nThe &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the\nLibrary&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)\n&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n\nThe modified work must itself be a software library.\n\nYou must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\nYou must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\ncharge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\nIf a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\ntable of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\nthe facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\nis invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\nin the event an application does not supply such function or\ntable, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\nits purpose remains meaningful.\n\n\n(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\na purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\napplication. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\napplication-supplied function or table used by this function must\nbe optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\nroot function must still compute square roots.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\nYou may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\nA program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\nHowever, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the\nlibrary&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\nWhen a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\nAs an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\nAccompany the work with the complete corresponding\nmachine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\nchanges were used in the work (which must be distributed under\nSections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\nwith the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that\nuses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the\nuser can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\nexecutable containing the modified Library. (It is understood\nthat the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\nLibrary will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\nto use the modified definitions.)\n\nUse a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\nLibrary. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\ncopy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\nrather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\nwill operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\nthe user installs one, as long as the modified version is\ninterface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\nAccompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\nleast three years, to give the same user the materials\nspecified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\nthan the cost of performing this distribution.\n\nIf distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\nspecified materials from the same place.\n\nVerify that the user has already received a copy of these\nmaterials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n\nFor an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the\nLibrary&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n\nAccompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\nbased on the Library, uncombined with any other library\nfacilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the\nSections above.\n\nGive prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\nthat part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\nwhere to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n\n\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\nEach time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.

In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.

If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\nalleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\nindirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\nby license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\ninfringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\ngranted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\ninto account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\nlicense.\n8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\nall end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\nwhich have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\nLIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\nDEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\nOR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\nANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\nCHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\nWORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\nCOMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\nINFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\nLIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\nRESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\nPROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\nEXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\nTHIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\nU.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\nThe Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined in\n48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer\nsoftware&quot; and &quot;commercial computer software documentation,&quot; as such\nterms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).

This is\ndone by using the expression .* to match all URLs, and the\nrule options Exclude and Crawl Content.\nEach subsequent rule adds a regular expression to match a\nspecific image extension, for example \\.png. and then uses the\nInclude option to override the previous rule and cause the\nfile to be downloaded. Once a match is made there is no need to\ncontinue checking rules, so the Stop Processing option is also\nset. Alternatively, you could just have a single rule which\nmatched multiple extensions, for example \\.(?:png|gif|jpg).\nWith these rules in place when you copy a website it will scan\nall HTML files but only download to the save folder those\nmatching the specified extensions.\n\n\nTip\nAdd new rules with different extensions to copy\ndifferent files, for example zip, exe or msi to download\nprograms.\n\n"},{target:"filespanel.html",title:"Files",text:'The files panel displays a list of all files in the website.\n\n\nTip\nYou can filter the contents of a list by entering\nsearch text into the field below the appropriate column\nheader.

If it\nis deeply nested, for example\nhttps://demo.cyotek.com/features, the Wizard will\nprompt to enable crawling above the root. If this option is not\nset, WebCopy will ignore any URLs above the entered\npath, for example https://demo.cyotek.com/html.\nChoosing local file options\nThe Where do you want to download to? page allows you to\nchoose the folder where downloaded files will be saved, and\nhow WebCopy processes the files and folders within.\nIn the Save folder field, enter or select the local path\nwhere you want the copied files to be stored.

Once you have filled in the appropriate\nvalues, click the Scan Forms  button to\ndetect the values you have entered\nAll non-hidden parameters will be automatically selected for\ninclusion in the form definition. The hidden parameters are\noften still required, but WebCopy will\nautomatically read them from the website and use them each\ntime it is posted.
